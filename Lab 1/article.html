    <h2>Pilot can't quite escape the shadow of Game of Thrones, but it's eminently watchable.</h2>

        Making a prequel to a beloved series is never easy, especially when it's a prequel to one
        of the most influential blockbuster series of the last decade—one that 
        <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/here-is-our-super-spoiler-y-review-of-the-game-of-thrones-series-finale/">whiffed its finale</a> 
        so badly that it alienated some of its most devoted fans. 
        <a href="https://www.max.com/shows/house-of-the-dragon/c68e69d7-9317-428a-a615-cdf8fe5a2e06">HBO's <i>House of the Dragon</i></a> 
        rose to the challenge, debuting last night with a solid, promising pilot episode. Granted, it
        suffers a bit in comparison with Game of Thrones (especially the earlier seasons). But
        this was an eminently watchable and entertaining pilot that might even win back some of
        those alienated fans if the rest of the season lives up to that promise.</p>

        As I've 
        <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/dragons-are-front-and-center-in-latest-house-of-the-dragon-trailer/">written previously</a>, 
        House of the Dragon is set about 200 years before the events
        of <i>Game of Thrones</i> and chronicles the beginning of the end of House Targaryen's reign.
        Those events culminated in a civil war and the extinction of the dragons—at least until
        Daenerys Targaryen came along. The primary source material is 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%26_Blood_(novel)"><i>Fire and Blood</i></a>, a fictional
        history of the Targaryen kings written by George R.R. Martin. The book begins with Aegon I's
        conquest of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, thanks to the family's advanced weaponry: dragons.
        This is followed by a period of relative peace before the inevitable succession crisis. The
        final two sections of <i>Fire and Blood</i> deal with the fallout of that crisis and serve as the
        primary source material for <i>House of the Dragon</i>.
